# React Map Application with OpenLayers

## Overview

This project is a React application that demonstrates how to use **OpenLayers** to integrate a map with polygon functionalities such as drawing, editing, and deleting polygons. The app also features a form for capturing user details like first name and mobile number, which are displayed on the map page.

## Features

- **Form Page**: A page with a form to input the user's first name and mobile number, saving the data in the application state.
- **State Management**: Uses React state to manage and pass form data between pages.
- **OpenLayers Map**: Displays a map with interactive polygon functionalities (draw, edit, and delete).
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive, adjusting for different screen sizes with media queries.
